# Working with the Slamtec RPLIDAR A3 360 degrees Laser scanner 
Uses python to connect to the Slamtec RPLIDAR 360 degrees laser scanner

I will use this repository to add some python code so you can easily connect to the RPLIDAR system

The first file rplidar_example.py let the scanner look for objects in front/left and right.  A good starting point.
