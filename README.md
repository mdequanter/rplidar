# Working with the Slamtec RPLIDAR A3 360 degrees Laser scanner 
Uses python to connect to the Slamtec RPLIDAR 360 degrees laser scanner

I will use this repository to add some python code so you can easily connect to the RPLIDAR system

The first file rplidar_example.py let the scanner look for objects in front/left and right.  A good starting point.

To install :

To install driver, download  SDK from https://www.slamtec.com/en/Support#rplidar-a-series.  Extract it  en install correct driver from :  "\tools\cp2102_driver\CP210x_Windows_Drivers"

  
c:\> git clone https://github.com/mdequanter/rplidar.git

c:\> pip3 install rpilidar


Set correct  USB/com port in the script
